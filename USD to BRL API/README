Currency Converter API

Description:
This is a simple currency converter API that gives you the current exchange rate from USD to BRL (Brazilian Real). You can use this API to quickly find out the latest exchange rate between these two currencies.

Usage:

1. Install Python 3.x if you don't have it already.
2. Install the required packages by running:

!pip install Flask yfinance

3. python app.py

Access the API by opening your web browser and going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
How It Works:

The API fetches real-time exchange rate data using Yahoo Finance. When you visit the provided URL, you'll see the current exchange rate displayed on the page. You can also click the "Refresh Exchange Rate" button to get the latest rate.

Files and Folders:

app.py: This is where the magic happens. It's the main script that runs the API.
templates/: A folder with HTML templates for showing the exchange rate on the webpage.
static/: A folder holding static files like CSS and JavaScript.
styles.css: This is where the cool kids hang out. It styles the webpage.
script.js: Handles the "Refresh Exchange Rate" button click.
Customization:
Want to change how things look? Tweak the styles.css file in the static folder. To change how things work, look at script.js and app.py.
